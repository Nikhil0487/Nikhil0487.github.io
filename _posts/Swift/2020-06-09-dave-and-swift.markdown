Setting up Swift on VSCode and fixing SourceKit-LSP [issues] led me to an interesting deep dive into Swift recently. 

- I came across this [issue] by Dave on Github,
- Then I realized that I recently listened to Sundell's [podcast] with Dave. It was a wonderful episode, they also talked about C++ STL (which I love BTW and have been using for sometime). This episode requires another post.
- So I followed [Dave] on GitHub (suprisingly I didnt do it earlier),
- Then I came across [this] repo about Quick Sort and Swift,
- This was about Quick sort and I know something about this algorithm. So I started diving deep,
- It led me to a Swift [bug] and a [post] by Dave in Swift forums,
- Suprisingly after reading Dave's code in the [post], I realized that I just gleaned a little bit of Swift Standard Library till now,
- So I decided to get familiarized with BiDirectionalCollection and a quick Duck Duck Going about it led me to this [Apple's] docs,
- At which point I realized I am not comfortable enough with Swift Standard Library overall and not just BiDirectionalCollection, so I went up two pages reaching Swift's official top level [page] about Swift Standard Library,
- This [page] led me to an excellent [playground] on Swift Standard Library basics which I am doing right now and highly recommend to my fellow Swift buddies. 

You can find me on [Twitter].
