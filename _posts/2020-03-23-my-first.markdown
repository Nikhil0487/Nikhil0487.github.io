To setup this Github page, I referred the link https://ndench.github.io/jekyll/setup-jekyll-on-github-pages one of the top results in DuckDuckGo. I did follow all the 
steps mentioned in that page meticulously. I did however hit a few road blocks. 

After cloning when I ran the below command

{% highlight bash %}
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

I got the below output and even after repeatedly giving admin password it didn't go away. 


 {% highlight bash %}
 Your user account isn't allowed to install to the system RubyGems.
  You can cancel this installation and run:

      bundle install --path vendor/bundle

  to install the gems into ./vendor/bundle/, or you can enter your password
  and install the bundled gems to RubyGems using sudo.

  Password: 
 {% endhighlight %}

 So as suggested by the above prompt I ran the below command.

{% highlight bash %}
bundle config set path 'vendor/bundle'
{% endhighlight %}

I also did another mistake, I had an outer Nikhil0487.github.io with a nested Nikhil0487.github.io folder. This also caused some confusion. So, make sure that you don't have same nested folders. This happens when you create a 'Nikhil0487.github.io' folder and then clone your pages repo inside it.

So, finally after sorting all the things out, its mandatory you setup _config.yml with relevant details as mentioned in the above linked page.

Finally, build and check your site locally before you push your changes to remote.

{% highlight bash %}
bundle exec jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

Also, the link (again a Github page) https://haisum.github.io/2014/11/07/jekyll-pygments-supported-highlighters/ contains a cheat sheet code highlighting in all major languages and can be bookmarked.
