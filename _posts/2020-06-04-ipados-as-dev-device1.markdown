title: Can iPadOS Be Made To Equal/Replace macOS

Recently I saw an old [video] of Tim Cooks from 2012. 

His views on iPad vs Mac were interesting and still relevant today especially after introducing 
iPadOS last year. Some of his main points were:

- No unification of iPad and Mac,
- MacBooks/macOS are not for wide spread adoption but will remain niche,
- Tabs will surpass laptop in usage in future,
- Tabs have their own purpose and problem to solve,
- Tabs imply that they don’t carry laptop’s legacy baggage,
- He specifically told no console in tab.

So with above points in mind what would I need as a developer for an iPad(OS) to be?
To answer this question, I have asked myself the below question.

What do I use mostly for developing macOS/iOS applications in MacBook?
1. IDEs to write code. I use mostly Xcode and VSCode, 
2. Scripting (bash/ksh predominantly) for build and automation stuff,
3. Console app for viewing logs,
4. Terminal for easy navigation across directories,
5. Terminal to launch apps, CLI tools, install pkg/dmg,
6. Browser (Safari mostly) for workplace (like interacting with people at work place and stuff),
7. Browser for all kinds of developer related stuff,
8. Terminal for git,
9. Finder app to view, open, modify files. 


Addressing each of the above points w.r.t iPadOS below and also assuming that I use iPad with keyboard and mouse.

1. I can open coding projects in Files app and use ported Xcode/VSCode apps,
2. Considering terminal is ruled out like Tim Cook said. Are there any replacements? Terminal with access to directories in /Users/ alone would be good.
3. Open Console app in iPad,
4. Use iPad’s Files application. 
5. Use iPad’s Files application,
6. Continue with the browser in iPad,
7. Continue with iPad’s browser
8. Xcode’s and VSCode git plugin as replacement. Although some quick functionalites will be missed,
9. Files app in iPadOS.

Some additional points:
1. Extend current Files app in iPadOS to have more functionalies like Finder in Mac,
2. iPadOS can have Terminal app and Files app with access to /Users/ directory alone considering iPadOS will be multi-user. (i.e.,) all directories under ~/)

So yes with, 
1. More computing power in iPadOS,
2. Keyboard/Mouse usage, 
3. Free access for Terminal/Files app of iPadOS to /Users/ directory, and 
4. Obviously porting of developer tools to iPadOS, would definitley make iPadOS to start behaving like a primary developer device.

Rumours are already spreading on Twitter about Xcode port to iPadOS. Let's wait and watch what's in store for iPadOS in WWDC 2020.

Will address issues about opening up Finder/Terminal to directories /Users/ alone in another post.
